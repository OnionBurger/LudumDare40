# Ludum Dare 40

This is my entry in the Ludum Dare 40 Compo. Ludum Dare is an online competition that occurs every 4 months. The goal is to create a game in a few days and share it with other competitors.

I participated in Compo category. This means I was working solo to develop a game in 48 hours, using only my own assets. As it was my first game jam, it taught me a lot about time management and crunch hours.

Rules of the competition ask that I share my source code, which is why I created this repository. Project is in C++. It uses SFML, which I did not include in this repository, but you will need it to successfully compile the code.

For creating levels, I used PlaneSmith. That is an open-source tool I created which you can find here: https://github.com/OnionBurger/PlaneSmith

# Crimson Assault

Real-time tactical shooter in which you control a group of expendable soldiers on a mission to prevent evil guerrilla forces from seizing power with their newfound artifacts of power (lava lamps). Destroy the artifacts, while freeing your brethren imprisoned by the enemy.

Move your squad and order them to attack enemies with right mouse clicks. You can destroy doors and cages. Cages contain more soldiers that will join you. Goal of each level is to destroy all lava lamps. Use WASD keys to move the camera.
